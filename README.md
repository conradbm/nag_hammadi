<h2> The Nag Hammadi Project</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>The goal of this project is to collect data, store the data, then analyze the data with some pre-existing data I have already collected.</h3>
<h3> In a more consise fashion, the goal of the project is as follows: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Approach the <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library.html">the following website</a> , grab all HTML</li>
<li>Continue to crawl through <em>important</em> links to find the necessary books of interest</li>
<li>Once the books of interest are found, scrape each of those and store them into a database by logical sections</li>
<li>After each book is scraped and stored, begin to look at text analytics to find similarities &amp; main topics between the books</li>
<li>Consider another unique project that could use the stored data (Say.. an iOS Application?)</li>
</ul>
