      "<p>Marvin Meyer held the chair of Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies and was co-chairman of Religious Studies at Chapman University in Orange, California.  He also served as director of the Albert Schweitzer Institute at the same university.  He was arguably the most prolific author and prestigious scholar of Gnostic literature in the world today.  Among the very large number of translations and commentaries dealing with Gnostic texts, some of the best known are  the international edition of <em>The</em> <em>Nag Hammadi Scriptures </em>(which he edited and to which he made major contributions), the normative edition the <em>The Gospel of Thomas,</em> his several works dealing with \"The Gospel of Judas\", and the splendid anthology, <em>The Gnostic Bible</em>, co-authored with Willis Barnstone.</p>\n",
      "<p>Marvin Meyer was a man after our heart.  We were personally acquainted with him for several decades, back to the time when he acted as assistant to Professor James Robinson at the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity in Claremont, California.  More importantly, he was truly sympathetic to our Gnostic tradition, while rejecting the academic fads of some of his colleagues which came to sow confusion in recent years.  In this regard he refuted the contention that the word \"Gnostic\" had no legitimacy in the present discourse.  (See his <a href=\"/naghamm/meyer-intro.html\">Introduction to <em>The Gnostic Bible</em></a>.)  The news of his death shocked and saddened all of us who knew him or knew of him. </p>\n",

The surviving writings of the tradition, known as the <a href=\"#CH\">Corpus Hermeticum</a> (the \"Hermetic body of writings\") were lost to the Latin West after classical times, but survived in eastern Byzantine libraries.

However for a modern reader there is a problem with  Mead's translations:  he often translates using  an antique and  formal-sounding    English. But then, it must be understood the original Greek texts of the surviving Hermetic literature have an antique and elevated tone. </p>\n",
      "<p>With his choice of language, Mead tries  to convey both the ambiguity and the the visionary intensity of the material.  He correctly understood the Hermetic writings as the distillations of  profound spiritual and psychological experiences — experiences the texts themselves call \"Gnosis\". These are not philosophical tracts. Their core impetus was communication of a visionary reality. The tradition that produced the Corpus Hermeticum embraced an imaginative, prophetic voice common in Gnostic scriptures; and the  insights  this \"Gnosis\" produced are not easily expressed in Greek, or Latin, or any pedestrian dialect of English. But they can by understood, if one has an ear for the core experience. It is the desire to communicate  their experience of interior reality that motivated these ancient authors.</p>\n",

There certainly seems to have been some interaction with other Gnostic movements forming in the early classical period.

      "<p>The eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries were marked by resurgence in Europe of spiritual movements of clearly Gnostic character. During the late eleventh century a Gnostic religion that had survived orthodox persecution for many centuries in the Byzantine Empire and on the Balkan Peninsula – the Bogomil religion – found its way to the Languedoc region of Southern France and to areas of Northern Italy. There it took root and flourished over the next three centuries as the Cathar religion -- the tradition of the Good and True Christians, the <em>Bons Hommes</em>. (The term \"Cathar\" was used in medieval times  in a derogatory fashion by opponents of the <em>Bons Hommes</em>; Cathars  simply called themselves      \"Good Christians.\") </p>\n",
      "<p>During these same centuries  in the area around  the Southern Pyrenees a form of heterodox mysticism took hold, a mysticism that had historical and archetypal roots in  the Gnosis and Gnosticism of late antiquity. At precisely  this time, and in the same area of Southern France,  there came the first flowering of the Troubadour traditions and of the Jewish Gnosticism of Kabbalah. To the south in Spain,  the mystical  tradition that   gave root to a Gnostic school in Islam took form – exemplified by Ibn 'Arabī  (1165–1240), the seminal figure in Turkish, Persian  and Sufi Gnostic traditions. St.  \n",
      "       Francis of Assisi (1181–1226) was also deeply influenced by the spirit of this time and this Cathar land.<img align=\"right\" border=\"3\" height=\"223\" hspace=\"10\" src=\"/images/innocentms2.gif\" vspace=\"10\" width=\"232\"/>\n",
      "<p>The relation of the  <em>Bons Hommes</em> with this heterodox flowering of Christian, Jewish and Islamic mystical traditions has long fascinated historians.  There is no verifiable answer to the relationship of these several movements, but the milieu in which they arose represents an obvious resurgence of Gnostic tradition: a spirit of Gnosis animated this time and region.        \n",
      "       <p>Unfortunately, the Crusade against the Cathars in the thirteenth century effectively eradicated the tradition and destroyed most of its primary documentary history. Only a few original Cathar texts are preserved. Among the most important surviving writing are a  Gospel text from the tradition of John and    an authentic liturgical  text  known as the <em>Cathar Ritual. </em>(Two manuscripts of the Cathar Ritual survive, one in Latin and one in Occitan; the version in Occitan  is often referred to as the \"Lyon Ritual\"). The longest surviving  Cathar text is the <em>Book of the Two Principles</em>,  a sophisticated and persuasive critique of orthodox theology. We  provide all three of these texts below.</p>\n",

      "    goes  a Bedouin shepherd found a collection of apparently ancient scrolls in a cave\n",
      "    above Khirbet Qumran, near the north end of the Dead Sea. Over the course of the next\n",
      "    year, seven scrolls from the cave reached scholarly hands. When examined by experts, the\n",
      "    importance and antiquity of the find was quickly understood. For starters, included among\n",
      "    these first seven scrolls was a fairly well-preserved copy of the biblical book of Isaiah,\n",
      "    soon determined to be the oldest complete manuscript of a Hebrew scripture yet discovered\n",
      "    and dating to before 100 BCE.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "    Another of the seven scrolls was of a more curious nature. Now named by researchers the\n",
      "    Community Rule (it was first translated and published under the title\n",
      "    \"Manual of Discipline\"), this large and fairly compete manuscript represented a\n",
      "    type of Jewish religious writing previously unknown. It appeared to be a document related\n",
      "    to the conduct and beliefs held within a sectarian Jewish community sometime between 150\n",
      "    BCE. and 70 CE.  a community seemingly very much like the Essenes described in\n",
      "    antiquity by the Jewish historian Josephus. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "    In 1949 a team lead by Roland de Vaux (an academic and Dominican priest who would\n",
      "    dominate Dead Sea Scroll studies for the next two decades) surveyed the cave at Qumran\n",
      "    where the scrolls had been found, discovering pottery shards and several more manuscript\n",
      "    fragments.  Two years later de Vaux directed archeological excavation of the Khirbet\n",
      "    Qumran ruins located just below the cave. <img align=\"right\" alt=\"The Ruins at Khirbet Qumran, by the Dead Sea\" border=\"2\" height=\"242\" hspace=\"9\" src=\"../../images/qumran_ruins.jpg\" title=\"The Ruins at Khirbet Qumran, by the Dead Sea\" vspace=\"10\" width=\"300\"/>Between 1952 and 1956 ten additional caves containing\n",
      "    scroll fragments were discovered near Qumran, almost all located by Bedouins who made a\n",
      "    business of scouring through the area. The most impressive cache  discovered again\n",
      "    by Bedouins working on at Qumran after de Vaux's 1952 expedition  was located in a\n",
      "    man-made cave less than 200 yards from Khirbet Qumran.  Named \"Cave 4\" (in\n",
      "    order of its discovery), it contained about 15,000 scroll fragments, identified eventually\n",

      "<p align=\"left\">Early in this period of discovery an hypothesis about the source and\n",

April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions. It is a fun approach, and it mostly works.  Suddenly strange old Gnostic myths transform into images that are inventive, edgy, and very thought provoking – they are myths with potent meaning. <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231170769/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Get the book</a></em> </p>\n",

      "<p align=\"left\">          The publication in 2009 of C. G. Jung's <em>The Red Book: Liber Novus</em> has initiated a broad reassessment of Jung’s place in cultural history. Among many revelations, the visionary events recorded in the Red Book reveal the foundation of Jung’s complex association with the Western tradition of Gnosis. </p>\n",
      "<p align=\"left\"><strong>In <em>The Search for Roots</em>, Alfred Ribi closely examines Jung’s life-long association with Gnostic tradition.</strong> Alfred Ribi is unique in the Jungian analytical community for the careful scholarship and intellectual rigor he has brought to the study Gnosticism. In <em>The Search for Roots</em>, Ribi shows how a dialogue between Jungian and Gnostic studies can open new perspectives on the experiential nature of Gnosis, both ancient and modern. Creative engagement with Gnostic tradition broadens the imaginative scope of modern depth psychology and adds an essential context for understanding the voice of the soul emerging in our modern age. Alfred Ribi's examination of Jung’s relationship with Gnostic tradition comes at an important time. Initially authored prior to the publication of Jung's Red Book, current release of this English edition offers a bridge between the past and the forthcoming understanding of Jung’s Gnostic roots.</p>\n",
      "<p align=\"left\"><strong>A Foreword by  Lance Owens supplements this volume with a discussion of Jung's encounter with Gnostic tradition while composing his Red Book (<em>Liber Novus</em>). </strong>Dr. Owens delivers a fascinating and historically well-documented account of how Gnostic mythology entered into Jung's personal mythology in the Red Book. Gnostic mythology thereafter became for Jung a prototypical image of his individuation.

      "<p>During WWI, Jung entered an extended visionary experience that he called his “confrontation with the unconscious.” Based on these visions, he subsequently developed his principal theories of the collective unconscious, the archetypes, psychological types and the process of individuation. Jung focused on transforming psychotherapy from a practice concerned with the treatment of pathology into a means for reconnection with the soul and the recovery of meaning in life. At the heart of this endeavor was his legendary Red Book, a large, leather bound, illuminated volume that he created between 1914 and 1930,  which contained the substance of his visions and became the nucleus of his later works. While Jung considered the <em>Red Book</em>, or <em>Liber Novus</em> (\" The New Book\") to be the central work in his oeuvre, it has remained unpublished till this day, and unavailable for study and unseen by the public at large. </p>\n",
      "<p>The Red Book is best described as a visionary and prophetic work, and not simply as an imaginative literary or scientific document. It is possibly the most influential unpublished work in the history of psychology. Its publication is a watershed that inaugurates a new era in the understanding of Jung’s life and work; it  fully reveals the experiential, Gnostic roots of Jung's psychology.  As Jung stated: </p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>\"The years … when I pursued the inner images were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life.... Everything later was merely the outer classification,the scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.” </p>\n",

      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Beginning in the years around the First World War, two extraordinary men were called to take an exceedingly difficult journey of exploration.  It was a voyage of discovery, a passage into the world of imagination. For the rest of their lives both men – J. R. R. Tolkien and C. G. Jung – affirmed that their mythopoetic fantasies had led them to something intrinsically real.   The figures they encountered in vision spoke with autonomous voices, and the tales they told were entwined with history and human destiny at the perilous threshold of a new age. </p>\n",
      "<p>Jung and Tolkien each struggled in solitude with the hermeneutic challenge of recording their experiences.  How does one recount in word and image the tale of a venture into vision? And how does one then interpret this record of an imaginal fact? </p>\n",
      "<p>In this lecture delivered at the California Institute of Integral studies, Dr. Owens examines the private accounts that both Jung and Tolkien scribed about their imaginative experiences – personal writings that remained mostly hidden for several decades after their deaths.  What did they \"think\" they were doing?  How did they understand “vision”?  What was their “hermeneutics of vision?”   And what interpretive approach will we now take to the strange tales of wayfarers who wander in the imaginal world?

      "<p>April DeConick has written one of the most important and thought-provoking books on Gnosticism to be published in several years. <em>The Gnostic New Age</em> takes a deep dive into its subject but does it with an entertaining and creative flare.   (And here the “old” new age, and the “new” new age do converge.)  April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.

      "<p>This short book is a  fine representative of the increasingly nuanced understanding of Gnostic tradition that has  developed over the last  decade.  In a concise and engaging fashion, Dr. Brakke explores key questions central to the study of Gnostic tradition: Who were the Gnostics? How did the Gnostic movement influence the development of Christianity in antiquity? Is it true that the Church rejected Gnosticism? In answer to these questions, Brakke  offers an illuminating discussion of recent scholarly debates over the concept of “Gnosticism” and the nature of early Christian diversity.  He shows how Gnostic myth and ritual addressed basic human concerns about alienation and meaning, offered a message of salvation in Jesus, and provided a way for people to regain knowledge of God, the ultimate source of their being. Rather than depicting the Gnostics as heretics or as the losers in the fight to define Christianity, Brakke argues that the Gnostics participated in an ongoing reinvention of Christianity, in which other Christians not only rejected their ideas but also adapted and transformed them.

The interviews published here represent some of the best of his many broad-ranging conversations.

While the interviews are animated by  the personal commitment each of these scholars feels for  Gnostic tradition, they also reveal the wide range of perspectives that now focus on Gnostic studies.

April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.  <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231170769/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Get the book</a></em> </p>\n",

      "<p>Jung's Red Book as well as other works, particularly Answer to Job and Aion bring into focus the issue of the changing God-image which Jung saw as having evolved in the history of the West, and as undergoing a new development today.  Dr. Hoeller draws on the sources and ramifications on this subject as present in the Red Book and more intimately in Jung's letters to such friends as Erich Neumann, Fr.

(And here the “old” new age, and the “new” new age do converge.)  April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.

In her critique of the Book of Revelation, she opens a discussion of the other revelatory texts, the Gnostic texts, that were excluded from the Christian canon. It is in Pagels' discussion of the message of the  many alternative Christian texts - the Gnostic  texts - that we think this book will be most valuable to a modern reader. <strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670023345/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Buy the Book</a></em></strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670023345/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\"></a></em></p>\n",

      "          by David Brakke  </h4>\n",
      "<p>This short book is a  fine representative of the increasingly nuanced understanding of Gnostic tradition that has  developed over the last  decade.  In a concise and engaging fashion, Dr. Brakke explores key questions central to the study of Gnostic tradition: Who were the Gnostics? How did the Gnostic movement influence the development of Christianity in antiquity? Is it true that the Church rejected Gnosticism? In answer to these questions, Brakke  offers an illuminating discussion of recent scholarly debates over the concept of “Gnosticism” and the nature of early Christian diversity.  He shows how Gnostic myth and ritual addressed basic human concerns about alienation and meaning, offered a message of salvation in Jesus, and provided a way for people to regain knowledge of God, the ultimate source of their being. Rather than depicting the Gnostics as heretics or as the losers in the fight to define Christianity, Brakke argues that the Gnostics participated in an ongoing reinvention of Christianity, in which other Christians not only rejected their ideas but also adapted and transformed them.

The interviews published here represent some of the best of his many broad-ranging conversations. If you have ever thought it might be interesting to sit down for an informal converstation with  \"the people who write these books on Gnosticism\" -- the  books you will find widely referenced and recommended here in <strong>The Gnosis Archive </strong>-- then you will very much enjoy this book. While the interviews are animated by  the personal commitment each of these scholars feels for  Gnostic tradition, they also reveal the wide range of perspectives that now focus on Gnostic studies. These interviews provide one of the best ways to get to know ancient Gnosticism, as seen through the eyes of its best informed modern students.

      "  The Gnostic New Age</em> takes a deep dive into its subject but does it with an entertaining and creative flare.   (And here the “old” new age, and the “new” new age do converge.)  April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.  <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231170769/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Get the book</a></em> </p>\n",

      "<p>Marvin Meyer held the chair of Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies and was co-chairman of Religious Studies at Chapman University in Orange, California.  He also served as director of the Albert Schweitzer Institute at the same university.  He was arguably the most prolific author and prestigious scholar of Gnostic literature in the world today.  Among the very large number of translations and commentaries dealing with Gnostic texts, some of the best known are  the international edition of <em>The</em> <em>Nag Hammadi Scriptures </em>(which he edited and to which he made major contributions), the normative edition the <em>The Gospel of Thomas,</em> his several works dealing with \"The Gospel of Judas\", and the splendid anthology, <em>The Gnostic Bible</em>, co-authored with Willis Barnstone.</p>\n",
      "<p>Marvin Meyer was a man after our heart.  We were personally acquainted with him for several decades, back to the time when he acted as assistant to Professor James Robinson at the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity in Claremont, California.  More importantly, he was truly sympathetic to our Gnostic tradition, while rejecting the academic fads of some of his colleagues which came to sow confusion in recent years.  In this regard he refuted the contention that the word \"Gnostic\" had no legitimacy in the present discourse.  (See his <a href=\"/naghamm/meyer-intro.html\">Introduction to <em>The Gnostic Bible</em></a>.)  The news of his death shocked and saddened all of us who knew him or knew of him. </p>\n",

      "<p>Marvin Meyer held the chair of Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies and was co-chairman of Religious Studies at Chapman University in Orange, California.  He also served as director of the Albert Schweitzer Institute at the same university.  He was arguably the most prolific author and prestigious scholar of Gnostic literature in the world today.  Among the very large number of translations and commentaries dealing with Gnostic texts, some of the best known are  the international edition of <em>The</em> <em>Nag Hammadi Scriptures </em>(which he edited and to which he made major contributions), the normative edition the <em>The Gospel of Thomas,</em> his several works dealing with \"The Gospel of Judas\", and the splendid anthology, <em>The Gnostic Bible</em>, co-authored with Willis Barnstone.</p>\n",
      "<p>Marvin Meyer was a man after our heart.  We were personally acquainted with him for several decades, back to the time when he acted as assistant to Professor James Robinson at the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity in Claremont, California.  More importantly, he was truly sympathetic to our Gnostic tradition, while rejecting the academic fads of some of his colleagues which came to sow confusion in recent years.  In this regard he refuted the contention that the word \"Gnostic\" had no legitimacy in the present discourse.  (See his <a href=\"/naghamm/meyer-intro.html\">Introduction to <em>The Gnostic Bible</em></a>.)  The news of his death shocked and saddened all of us who knew him or knew of him. </p>\n",

      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>The gospel of truth is joy for those who have received from the father of truth the grace of knowing him by the power of the word,  who has come from the fullness  and who is in the thought and the mind of the father. This is the one who is called the savior, since that is the name of the work that he must do for the redemption of those who have not known the father. For the name of the gospel is the revelation of hope, since that is the discovery of those who seek him, because the realm of all sought him from whom it came. You see, all was inside of him, that illimitable, inconceivable one, who is better than every thought. </p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p><strong>IGNORANCE OF THE FATHER BRINGS ERROR </strong></p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>This ignorance of the father brought about terror and fear.  And terror became dense like a fog, so no one was able to see. Because of this, error  became strong. But she worked on her material substance  vainly, because she did not know the truth. She assumed a fashioned figure while she was preparing, in power and in beauty, the substitute for truth. </p>\n",
      "<p>This, then, was not a humiliation for the illimitable, inconceivable one. For they were as nothing, this terror and this forgetfulness and this figure of falsehood, whereas established truth is unchanging, unperturbed, and completely beautiful. </p>\n",
      "<p>For this reason, do not take error too seriously. </p>\n",
      "<p>Since error had no root, she was in a fog regarding the father. She was preparing works and forgetfulnesses and fears in order, by these means, to beguile those of the middle  and to make them captive. The forgetfulness of error was not revealed. It did not become light beside the father. Forgetfulness did not exist with the father, although it existed because of him.  What exists in him is knowledge, which was revealed so that forgetfulness might be destroyed and that the father might be known. Since forgetfulness existed because the father was not known, if the father comes to be known, from that moment on forgetfulness will cease to exist. </p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p><strong>JESUS IS THE FRUIT OF KNOWLEDGE </strong></p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>That is the gospel of him whom they seek, which he has revealed to the perfect through the mercies of the father as the hidden mystery, Jesus the anointed.  Through him he enlightened those who were in darkness because of forgetfulness. He enlightened them and gave them a path. And that path is the truth that he taught them.  For this reason error was angry with him, so she persecuted him. She was distressed by him, and she was made powerless. He was nailed to a tree.  He became a fruit of the knowledge of the father. He did not, however, destroy them because they ate of it. He rather caused those who ate of it to be joyful because of this discovery. </p>\n",
      "<p>And as for him, he found them in himself, and they found him in themselves, that illimitable, inconceivable one, that perfect father who made all, in whom the realm of all is, and whom the realm of all lacks, since he retained in himself their perfection, which he had not given to all.  The father was not jealous. What jealousy, indeed, is there between him and his members? For, even if the eternal being had received their  perfection, they would not have been able to approach the perfection of the father, because he retained their perfection in himself, giving it to them as a way to return to him and as a knowledge unique in perfection. He is the one who set all in order and in whom all existed and whom all lacked. As one of whom some have no knowledge, he wants them to know him and love him. What did they lack, if not the knowledge of the father? </p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p><strong>JESUS AS QUIET GUIDE </strong></p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Jesus became a guide, quiet and at leisure. In the middle of a school he came and spoke the word, as a teacher. Those who were wise in their own estimation came to put him to the test. But he discredited them as empty-headed people. They hated him because they really were not wise. After all these came also the little children, those who possess the knowledge of the father. When they became strong they were taught the aspects of the father’s face. They came to know and they were known. They were glorified and they gave glory. </p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p><strong>THE LIVING BOOK IN THE HEART OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN </strong></p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>In their heart, the living book of the living was manifest, the book that was written in the thought and in the mind of the father and, from before the foundation of all, is in that incomprehensible part of him. </p>\n",
      "<p>This is the book that no one found possible to take, since it was reserved for him who will take it and be slain. No one could appear among those who believed in salvation as long as that book had not appeared. For this reason, the compassionate, faithful Jesus was patient in his sufferings until he took that book, since he knew that his death meant life for many.  Just as in the case of a will that has not yet been opened, the fortune of the deceased master of the house is hidden, so also in the case of all that had been hidden as long as the father of all was invisible and unique in himself, in whom every space has its source. For this reason Jesus appeared. He put on that book. He was nailed to a cross. He affixed the edict of the father to the cross. </p>\n",
      "<p>Oh, such great teaching! He abases himself even unto death, though he is clothed in eternal life. Having divested himself of these perishable rags,  he clothed himself in incorruptibility, which no one could possibly take from him. Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he passed before those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection, proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the father, so that he became the wisdom of those who have received instruction. But those who are to be taught, the living who are inscribed in the book of the living, learn for themselves, receiving instructions from the father, turning to him again. </p>\n",
      "<p>Since the perfection of all is in the father, it is necessary for all to ascend to him. Therefore, if one has knowledge, he gets what belongs to him and draws it to himself. For one who is ignorant is deficient, and it is a great deficiency, since he lacks that which will make him perfect. Since the perfection of all is in the father, it is necessary for all to ascend to him and for each one to get the things that are his. He wrote these things first, having prepared them to be given to those who came from him. </p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p><strong>THE FATHER CALLING THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWLEDGE </strong></p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Those whose names he knew first were called last, so that the one who has knowledge is one whose name the father has pronounced.  For one whose name has not been spoken is ignorant. Indeed, how shall one hear if a name has not been uttered? For whoever remains ignorant until the end is a creature of forgetfulness and will perish with it. If this is not so, why have these wretches no name, why have they no voice? Hence, whoever has knowledge is from above. If called, that person hears, replies, and turns toward him who called. That person ascends to him and knows how he is called. Having knowledge, that person does the will of him who called. That person desires to please him, finds rest,  and receives a certain name. Those who thus are going to have knowledge know whence they came and whither they are going.

For he revealed it as a knowledge with which all its emanations agree, namely, the knowledge of the living book that he revealed to the eternal beings at last as his letters, displaying to them that these are not merely vowels or consonants, so that one may read them and think of something void of meaning. On the contrary, they are letters that convey the truth. They are pronounced only when they are known. Each letter is a perfect truth like a perfect book, for they are letters written by the hand of the unity, since the father wrote them for the eternal beings, so that they by means of his letters might come to know the father.  </p>\n",

He reveals his hidden self, which is his son, so that through the compassion of the father the eternal beings may know him, end their wearying search for the father, and rest themselves in him, knowing that this is rest.

As one’s ignorance disappears when one gains knowledge, and as darkness disappears when light appears, so also incompleteness is eliminated by completeness. Certainly, from that moment on, form is no longer manifest but will be dissolved in fusion with unity. Now their works lie scattered. In time unity will make the spaces complete.

Like people who have moved from a house, if they have some dishes around that are not good, they are broken. Nevertheless, the householder does not suffer a loss but rejoices, for in the place of these defective dishes there are those that are completely perfect. For this is the judgment that has come from above and that has judged every person, a drawn two-edged sword cutting on this side and that.  When the word appeared, who is in the heart of those who pronounce it—it was not merely a sound but has become a body—a great disturbance occurred among the dishes, for some were emptied, others filled; some were provided for, others were removed; some were purified, still others were broken. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed for they had no composure nor stability. Error was disturbed, not knowing what she should do. She was troubled, she lamented, she was beside herself because she did not know anything. When knowledge, which is the abolishment of error, approached her with all her emanations, error was empty, since there was nothing in her. Truth appeared; all its emanations recognized it. They greeted the father in truth with a power which is complete and which joins them with the father. </p>\n",

For who is it who exists if it is not the father himself? All the spaces are his emanations. They knew that they stem from him as children from a perfect man. They knew that they had not yet received form, nor had they yet received a name, every one of which the father produces. If they at that time receive the form of his knowledge, though they are truly in him, they do not know him.  But the father is perfect. He knows every space that is within him. If he pleases,  he reveals anyone whom he desires by giving him a form and by giving him a name; and he does give a name and cause to come into being. Those who do not yet exist are ignorant of him who created them. I do not say, then, that those who do not yet exist are nothing.  But they are in him who will desire that they exist when he pleases, like an event that is going to happen. On the one hand, he knows, before anything is revealed, what he will produce. On the other hand, the fruit that has not yet been revealed does not know anything nor is anything either. Thus each space that, on its part, is in the father comes from the existent one, who, on his part, has established it from the nonexistent.

Until the moment when they who are passing through all these things—I mean they who have experienced all these confusions—awaken, they see nothing because the dreams were nothing. It is thus that they who cast ignorance from them like sleep do not consider it to be anything, nor regard its properties to be something real, but they renounce them like a dream in the night and they consider the knowledge of the father to be the dawn.  It is thus that each one has acted, as if asleep, during the time of ignorance, and thus a person comes to understand, as if awakening.

Light spoke through his mouth, and his voice brought forth life. He gave them thought and understanding and mercy and salvation, and the spirit of strength derived from the infinity and sweetness of the father. He caused punishments and scourgings to cease, for it was they that caused many in need of mercy to stray from him in error and in chains—and he mightily destroyed them and derided them with knowledge.

For this reason, the father loves his aroma; and it manifests itself in every place; and when it is mixed with matter, he gives his aroma to the light; and into his rest he causes it to ascend in every form and in every sound. For it is not ears that smell the aroma, but it is the spirit that possesses the sense of smell and draws it for itself to itself and sinks into the aroma of the father. Thus the spirit cares for it and takes it to the place from which it has come, the first aroma, which has grown cold. It is in a psychical form, resembling cold water  that has sunk into soil that is not hard, of which those who see it think, “It is earth.” Afterward, it evaporates if a breath of wind draws it, and it becomes warm. The cold aromas, then, are from division.

The deficiency of matter, however, is not because of the infinity of the father, who came to give time to deficiency. In fact, it is not right to say that the incorruptible one will come in this manner. The depth of the father is profound, and the thought of error is not with him. It is a matter of falling down and a matter of being readily set upright at the discovery of the one who has come to what he would bring back. </p>\n",

Forgiveness is that which remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of the fullness. For the doctor hurries to the place where there is sickness, because that is the doctor’s wish. The sick person is in a deficient condition but does not hide, because the doctor possesses what the patient lacks. In this manner the deficiency is filled by the fullness, which has no deficiency, and which was given in order to fill the one deficient, so that the person may receive grace. For while deficient, this person had no grace. Because of this a diminishing occurred where there is no grace. When the diminished part was restored, the person in need revealed himself as fullness.

Since they were in the depth of his mind, the word,  who was the first to come forth, caused them to appear, along with an intellect that speaks the unique word by means of a silent grace. It was called thought, since they were in it before becoming manifest.  It happened, then, that the word was the first to come forth at the moment pleasing to the will of him who desired it; and it is in the will that the father is at rest and with which he is pleased. Nothing happens without him, nor does anything occur without the will of the father. But his will is incomprehensible. His will is his footstep,  but no one can know it, nor is it possible for them to concentrate on it in order to possess it. But that which he wishes takes place at the moment he wishes it—even if the view does not please people before god: it is the father’s will. For the father knows the beginning of them all as well as their end. For when their end arrives, he will greet them. The end, you see, is the recognition of him who is hidden, that is, the father, from whom the beginning came forth and to whom will return all who have come from him.

He gave him his name, which belonged to him—he, the father, who possesses everything that exists around him. He possesses the name; he has the son. It is possible for the son to be seen. The name, however, is invisible, for it alone is the mystery of the invisible about to come to ears completely filled with it through the father’s agency. Moreover, as for the father, his name is not pronounced but is revealed through a son. Thus, then, the name is great. </p>\n",
      "<p>Who, then, has been able to pronounce a name for him, this great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs and the children of the name, in whom the name of the father is at rest, and who themselves in turn are at rest in his name, since the father has no beginning?  It is he alone who conceived it for himself as a name, in the beginning before he had created the eternal beings, that the name of the father should be supreme over them—that is, the true name, which is secure by his authority and by his perfect power. For the name is not drawn from lexicons, nor is his name derived from common name-giving. It is invisible. The father alone gave the son a name, because he alone saw him and because he alone was capable of giving him a name. For he who does not exist has no name. For what name would one give him who did not exist? Nevertheless, he who exists exists also with his name, and he alone knows it, and to him alone the father gave a name. He is the father, his name is the son. He did not, therefore, keep it secretly hidden, but it came into existence, and the son himself disclosed the name. The name, then, is that of the father, just as the name of the father is the beloved son. For otherwise, where would he find a name except from the father? But someone will probably say to a friend, “Who would give a name to someone who existed before himself, as if, indeed, children did not receive their name from one of those who gave them birth?” </p>\n",
      "<p>Above all, then, it is fitting for us to think this point over: what is the name? This is the true name, the name that came from the father, for it is he who owns the name. He did not, you see, get the name on loan, as in the case of others, who receive names that are made up. This is the proper name. There is no one else to whom he has given it. It remained unnamed, unuttered, till the moment when he who is perfect pronounced it himself; and it was he alone who was able to pronounce his name and to see it. When it pleased the father, then, that his son should be his pronounced name, and when he who has come from the depth disclosed this name, he divulged what was hidden, because he knew that the father was absolute goodness. For this reason, indeed, the father brought this particular one forth, that he might speak concerning the realm and his place of rest from which he had come forth, and that he might glorify the fullness, the greatness of his name and the sweetness of the father. </p>\n",

He assigned their destinies. They, then, became manifest individually that they might be perfected in their own thought, for that place to which they extend their thought is their root, which lifts them upward through all heights to the father. They reach his head, which is rest for them, and they remain there near to it as though to say that they have touched his face by means of embraces. But they do not make this plain. For neither have they exalted themselves nor have they diminished the glory of the father, nor have they thought of him as small, nor bitter, nor angry, but as absolutely good, unperturbed, sweet, knowing all the spaces before they came into existence and having no need of instruction. </p>\n",
      "<p>Such are they who possess from above something of this immeasurable greatness, as they strain toward that unique and perfect One who exists there for them.  And they do not go down to Hades.  They have neither envy nor moaning, nor is death in them. But they rest in him who rests, without wearying themselves or becoming confused about truth. But they, indeed, are the truth, and the father is in them, and they are in the father, since they are perfect, inseparable from him who is truly good. They lack nothing in any way, but they are given rest and are refreshed by the spirit. And they listen to their root; they are busy with concerns in which one will find his root, and one will suffer no loss to his soul. </p>\n",
      "<p>Such is the place of the blessed; this is their place. As for the others, then, may they know, in their place, that it does not suit me, after having been in the place of rest, to say anything more.  It is there I shall dwell in order to devote myself, at all times, to the father of all and the true friends,  those upon whom the love of the father is lavished, and in whose midst nothing of him is lacking. It is they who manifest themselves truly, since they are in that true and eternal life and speak of the perfect light filled with the seed of the father, which is in his heart and in the fullness, while his spirit rejoices in it and glorifies him in whom it was, because the father is good. And his children are perfect and worthy of his name, because he is the father. Children of this kind are those whom he loves. </p>\n",

      "<p>For an introduction to the   Prophet Mani and the Manichaean tradition, we suggest listening to a  lecture by Dr. Stephan Hoeller: <a href=\"/audio/971212.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Mani: Helmsman of the Ship\n",

Originally many texts in Latin and Greek certainly existed, but during the persecution of the movement in the West most of these were lost (a major  exception is the Greek <em>Cologne Mani-Codex, </em>recovered  in 1969). What remains to us  in large part was recorded in several different and  now little-studied ancient languages (including Coptic, Middle Persian, Sogdian, Parthian, Uigur, Bactrian and Chinese). These  languages well represent the vast geographical area influenced by the mission of the Prophet Mani.</p>\n",

How many will be lost? How many will be destroyed? A thousand lost, another thousand recovered; for they will find them at the end. They will kiss them, and say: \"O Wisdom of Greatness, O Armor of the Apostle of Light! When you were lost ... where did they find you?\" ... And you shall find them reading them aloud, uttering the name [of each book] among them: the name of its lord .. and the name of those who gave all [for it to be written] and the name of the scribe who wrote it... and of the one who punctuated it.... <em> (Homilies 23.13-25.19)</em></p>\n",

However for a modern reader there is a problem with  Mead's translations:  he often translates using  an antique and  formal-sounding    English. But then, it must be understood the original Greek texts of the surviving Hermetic literature have an antique and elevated tone. </p>\n",
      "<p>With his choice of language, Mead tries  to convey both the ambiguity and the the visionary intensity of the material.  He correctly understood the Hermetic writings as the distillations of  profound spiritual and psychological experiences — experiences the texts themselves call \"Gnosis\". These are not philosophical tracts. Their core impetus was communication of a visionary reality. The tradition that produced the Corpus Hermeticum embraced an imaginative, prophetic voice common in Gnostic scriptures; and the  insights  this \"Gnosis\" produced are not easily expressed in Greek, or Latin, or any pedestrian dialect of English. But they can by understood, if one has an ear for the core experience. It is the desire to communicate  their experience of interior reality that motivated these ancient authors.</p>\n",

However for a modern reader there is a problem with  Mead's translations:  he often translates using  an antique and  formal-sounding    English. But then, it must be understood the original Greek texts of the surviving Hermetic literature have an antique and elevated tone. </p>\n",
      "<p>With his choice of language, Mead tries  to convey both the ambiguity and the the visionary intensity of the material.  He correctly understood the Hermetic writings as the distillations of  profound spiritual and psychological experiences — experiences the texts themselves call \"Gnosis\". These are not philosophical tracts. Their core impetus was communication of a visionary reality. The tradition that produced the Corpus Hermeticum embraced an imaginative, prophetic voice common in Gnostic scriptures; and the  insights  this \"Gnosis\" produced are not easily expressed in Greek, or Latin, or any pedestrian dialect of English. But they can by understood, if one has an ear for the core experience. It is the desire to communicate  their experience of interior reality that motivated these ancient authors.</p>\n",

      "    above Khirbet Qumran, near the north end of the Dead Sea. Over the course of the next\n",
      "    year, seven scrolls from the cave reached scholarly hands. When examined by experts, the\n",

      "    Community Rule (it was first translated and published under the title\n",
      "    \"Manual of Discipline\"), this large and fairly compete manuscript represented a\n",
      "    type of Jewish religious writing previously unknown. It appeared to be a document related\n",
      "    to the conduct and beliefs held within a sectarian Jewish community sometime between 150\n",
      "    BCE. and 70 CE.  a community seemingly very much like the Essenes described in\n",

      "    In 1949 a team lead by Roland de Vaux (an academic and Dominican priest who would\n",

      "    business of scouring through the area. The most impressive cache  discovered again\n",
      "    by Bedouins working on at Qumran after de Vaux's 1952 expedition  was located in a\n",
      "    man-made cave less than 200 yards from Khirbet Qumran.  Named \"Cave 4\" (in\n",

      "    disclosed from early excavations at Khirbet Qumran all worked neatly into the story: the\n",

      "    the \"Qumran-Essene dogma\"  became a party line in Dead Sea Scrolls studies\n",
      "    for the next 40 years. The integrity of this thesis was buttressed by highly restricted\n",

      "<p>Marvin Meyer held the chair of Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies and was co-chairman of Religious Studies at Chapman University in Orange, California.  He also served as director of the Albert Schweitzer Institute at the same university.  He was arguably the most prolific author and prestigious scholar of Gnostic literature in the world today.  Among the very large number of translations and commentaries dealing with Gnostic texts, some of the best known are  the international edition of <em>The</em> <em>Nag Hammadi Scriptures </em>(which he edited and to which he made major contributions), the normative edition the <em>The Gospel of Thomas,</em> his several works dealing with \"The Gospel of Judas\", and the splendid anthology, <em>The Gnostic Bible</em>, co-authored with Willis Barnstone.</p>\n",
      "<p>Marvin Meyer was a man after our heart.  We were personally acquainted with him for several decades, back to the time when he acted as assistant to Professor James Robinson at the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity in Claremont, California.  More importantly, he was truly sympathetic to our Gnostic tradition, while rejecting the academic fads of some of his colleagues which came to sow confusion in recent years.  In this regard he refuted the contention that the word \"Gnostic\" had no legitimacy in the present discourse.  (See his <a href=\"/naghamm/meyer-intro.html\">Introduction to <em>The Gnostic Bible</em></a>.)  The news of his death shocked and saddened all of us who knew him or knew of him. </p>\n",

      "    by April D. DeConick </strong></p>\n",
      "<p>April DeConick has written one of the most important and thought-provoking books on Gnosticism to be published in several years. <em>The Gnostic New Age</em> takes a deep dive into its subject but does it with an entertaining and creative flare.   (And here the “old” new age, and the “new” new age do converge.)  April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.

It is in Pagels' discussion of the message of the  many alternative Christian texts - the Gnostic  texts - that we think this book will be most valuable to a modern reader. <strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670023345/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Buy the Book</a></em></strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670023345/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\"></a></em></p>\n",

      "          by David Brakke  </h4>\n",
      "<p>This short book is a  fine representative of the increasingly nuanced understanding of Gnostic tradition that has  developed over the last  decade.  In a concise and engaging fashion, Dr. Brakke explores key questions central to the study of Gnostic tradition: Who were the Gnostics? How did the Gnostic movement influence the development of Christianity in antiquity? Is it true that the Church rejected Gnosticism? In answer to these questions, Brakke  offers an illuminating discussion of recent scholarly debates over the concept of “Gnosticism” and the nature of early Christian diversity.  He shows how Gnostic myth and ritual addressed basic human concerns about alienation and meaning, offered a message of salvation in Jesus, and provided a way for people to regain knowledge of God, the ultimate source of their being. Rather than depicting the Gnostics as heretics or as the losers in the fight to define Christianity, Brakke argues that the Gnostics participated in an ongoing reinvention of Christianity, in which other Christians not only rejected their ideas but also adapted and transformed them.

The interviews published here represent some of the best of his many broad-ranging conversations. If you have ever thought it might be interesting to sit down for an informal converstation with  \"the people who write these books on Gnosticism\" -- the  books you will find widely referenced and recommended here in <strong>The Gnosis Archive </strong>-- then you will very much enjoy this book. While the interviews are animated by  the personal commitment each of these scholars feels for  Gnostic tradition, they also reveal the wide range of perspectives that now focus on Gnostic studies. These interviews provide one of the best ways to get to know ancient Gnosticism, as seen through the eyes of its best informed modern students.

      "  The Gnostic New Age</em> takes a deep dive into its subject but does it with an entertaining and creative flare.   (And here the “old” new age, and the “new” new age do converge.)  April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.  <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231170769/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Get the book</a></em> </p>\n",

April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions. It is a fun approach, and it mostly works.  Suddenly strange old Gnostic myths transform into images that are inventive, edgy, and very thought provoking – they are myths with potent meaning. <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231170769/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Get the book</a></em> </p>\n",

      "<p>Owens illustrates how in the first volume of this \"last quartet\"<em>—</em><em>The Psychology of the Transference</em>, published in 1946<em>—</em>Jung employed a sixteenth-century alchemical text to provide context for what is in fact a statement about his own experience with love recounted both in his private journals and in <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>\n",

      "<p align=\"left\">          The publication in 2009 of C. G. Jung's <em>The Red Book: Liber Novus</em> has initiated a broad reassessment of Jung’s place in cultural history. Among many revelations, the visionary events recorded in the Red Book reveal the foundation of Jung’s complex association with the Western tradition of Gnosis. </p>\n",
      "<p align=\"left\"><strong>In <em>The Search for Roots</em>, Alfred Ribi closely examines Jung’s life-long association with Gnostic tradition.</strong> Alfred Ribi is unique in the Jungian analytical community for the careful scholarship and intellectual rigor he has brought to the study Gnosticism. In <em>The Search for Roots</em>, Ribi shows how a dialogue between Jungian and Gnostic studies can open new perspectives on the experiential nature of Gnosis, both ancient and modern. Creative engagement with Gnostic tradition broadens the imaginative scope of modern depth psychology and adds an essential context for understanding the voice of the soul emerging in our modern age. Alfred Ribi's examination of Jung’s relationship with Gnostic tradition comes at an important time. Initially authored prior to the publication of Jung's Red Book, current release of this English edition offers a bridge between the past and the forthcoming understanding of Jung’s Gnostic roots.</p>\n",

      "<p>During WWI, Jung entered an extended visionary experience that he called his “confrontation with the unconscious.” Based on these visions, he subsequently developed his principal theories of the collective unconscious, the archetypes, psychological types and the process of individuation. Jung focused on transforming psychotherapy from a practice concerned with the treatment of pathology into a means for reconnection with the soul and the recovery of meaning in life. At the heart of this endeavor was his legendary Red Book, a large, leather bound, illuminated volume that he created between 1914 and 1930,  which contained the substance of his visions and became the nucleus of his later works. While Jung considered the <em>Red Book</em>, or <em>Liber Novus</em> (\" The New Book\") to be the central work in his oeuvre, it has remained unpublished till this day, and unavailable for study and unseen by the public at large. </p>\n",
      "<p>The Red Book is best described as a visionary and prophetic work, and not simply as an imaginative literary or scientific document. It is possibly the most influential unpublished work in the history of psychology. Its publication is a watershed that inaugurates a new era in the understanding of Jung’s life and work; it  fully reveals the experiential, Gnostic roots of Jung's psychology.  As Jung stated: </p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>\"The years … when I pursued the inner images were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life.... Everything later was merely the outer classification,the scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.” </p>\n",

      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Beginning in the years around the First World War, two extraordinary men were called to take an exceedingly difficult journey of exploration.  It was a voyage of discovery, a passage into the world of imagination. For the rest of their lives both men – J. R. R. Tolkien and C. G. Jung – affirmed that their mythopoetic fantasies had led them to something intrinsically real.   The figures they encountered in vision spoke with autonomous voices, and the tales they told were entwined with history and human destiny at the perilous threshold of a new age. </p>\n",
      "<p>Jung and Tolkien each struggled in solitude with the hermeneutic challenge of recording their experiences.  How does one recount in word and image the tale of a venture into vision? And how does one then interpret this record of an imaginal fact? </p>\n",
      "<p>In this lecture delivered at the California Institute of Integral studies, Dr. Owens examines the private accounts that both Jung and Tolkien scribed about their imaginative experiences – personal writings that remained mostly hidden for several decades after their deaths.  What did they \"think\" they were doing?  How did they understand “vision”?  What was their “hermeneutics of vision?”   And what interpretive approach will we now take to the strange tales of wayfarers who wander in the imaginal world?

This was commonly referred to as Jung's \"Gnostic ring.\" When he acquired the stone and had it mounted into a ring is not clear. However, most photos taken after 1930 show the ring on Jung's hand.

      "<p>April DeConick has written one of the most important and thought-provoking books on Gnosticism to be published in several years. <em>The Gnostic New Age</em> takes a deep dive into its subject but does it with an entertaining and creative flare.   (And here the “old” new age, and the “new” new age do converge.)  April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.

      "<p>This short book is a  fine representative of the increasingly nuanced understanding of Gnostic tradition that has  developed over the last  decade.  In a concise and engaging fashion, Dr. Brakke explores key questions central to the study of Gnostic tradition: Who were the Gnostics? How did the Gnostic movement influence the development of Christianity in antiquity? Is it true that the Church rejected Gnosticism? In answer to these questions, Brakke  offers an illuminating discussion of recent scholarly debates over the concept of “Gnosticism” and the nature of early Christian diversity.  He shows how Gnostic myth and ritual addressed basic human concerns about alienation and meaning, offered a message of salvation in Jesus, and provided a way for people to regain knowledge of God, the ultimate source of their being. Rather than depicting the Gnostics as heretics or as the losers in the fight to define Christianity, Brakke argues that the Gnostics participated in an ongoing reinvention of Christianity, in which other Christians not only rejected their ideas but also adapted and transformed them.

The interviews published here represent some of the best of his many broad-ranging conversations.

While the interviews are animated by  the personal commitment each of these scholars feels for  Gnostic tradition, they also reveal the wide range of perspectives that now focus on Gnostic studies.

April DeConick begins each of her ten thematic chapters by revisiting the story line of a popular movie from the last twenty years. She kicks off the show with a dive into the <em>The Matrix</em>, inviting readers to take the Gnostic red pill.  Thereafter, chapter-by-chapter, she pulls us into private screenings of <em>The Truman Show, Avatar, Superman, Star Trek V, Dark City,</em> and a couple less-known films.  Having set the stage in each chapter with storylines emerging from modern cinematic imagination, she then recounts in full scholarly detail the corresponding ancient Gnostic texts and tales, illustrating the parallel thematic intentions.  <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231170769/ref=nosim/gnosisarchive\">Get the book</a></em> </p>\n",
